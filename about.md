## About Eclipse Deeplearning4j

Eclipse Deeplearning4j is an open-source, distributed deep-learning project in Java and Scala spearheaded by the people at [Konduit](https://konduit.ai/), a San Francisco-based business intelligence and enterprise software firm. We're a team of data scientists, deep-learning specialists, Java systems engineers and semi-sentient robots.

There are a lot of knobs to turn when you're training a distributed deep-learning network. We've done our best to explain them, so that Eclipse Deeplearning4j can serve as a DIY tool for Java, Scala and Clojure programmers working on Hadoop and other file systems.
