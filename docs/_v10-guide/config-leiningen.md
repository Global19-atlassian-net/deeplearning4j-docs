## Configuring Automated Build Tools

Clojure programmers may want to use [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/) or [Boot](http://boot-clj.com/) to work with Maven. A [Leiningen tutorial is here](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/TUTORIAL.md).

NOTE: You'll still need to download ND4J, DataVec and Deeplearning4j, or doubleclick on the their respective JAR files file downloaded by Maven / Ivy / Gradle, to install them in your Eclipse installation.
